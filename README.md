# Stupid Hackathon X Challenge

A Drawdy extension with five challenges for Stupid Hackathon X (10-11 October 2026, Cleverse Office, 13th floor). It uses the [Drawdy Driver Protocol](https://github.com/drawdyio/drawdy-driver-protocol).

When the extension loads, it finds an empty part of the board, moves the camera there and shows the intro. Click **Yes** to start. After each solved challenge a green **Go** button appears. Clicking it moves the camera to a new empty area, fades the old challenge out and removes it.

If something a challenge needs is deleted (by you, by undo, or by a collaborator), the extension goes back to the intro and shows what went missing.

## The challenges (spoilers)

| # | Challenge | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Sign up for Drawdy. | Sign in with Drawdy's own sign-in button. The page reloads after sign-in and the challenge passes. If you were already signed in, it passes right away. |
| 2 | Click two buttons at the same time. | Drag one button on top of the other, then click where they overlap. Dropping a button does not count as a click. |
| 3 | Find the rectangle in 8,000 shapes and click on it. | There is no rectangle. Draw one with the rectangle tool. |
| 4 | Click Diny. She runs away from the cursor and opens her mouth while she runs. | Tap her on a touch screen, or switch devtools to touch emulation. A touch never moves the cursor before the tap, so she does not see it coming. After 30 seconds you pass anyway with "อกไก่ยังมีคนหมัก แต่อกหักต้องปล่อยเขาไปนะพี่นะ". |
| 5 | อย่าชนขอบ: get out of a slowly moving 7 by 7 maze. | Pick the laser pointer (the challenge says so), press the green Start circle and drag out of the exit without touching a wall. |

## Getting it wrong

Every wrong move (No on the intro, one button, a shape that isn't a rectangle, chasing Diny, touching a wall, the wrong tool, letting go early, deleting challenge elements) raises an annoyance level. The level drops by one every 30 seconds without a wrong move, and by two when a challenge is solved. As it rises, the replies get worse:

| Level | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| 0-2 | A plain reply, then a snarkier one. Each kind of mistake has its own lines, then falls back to general meltdown lines. |
| 3+ | The toast turns red, gets a shouting title and shakes. |
| 4+ | The camera shakes, harder each level. |
| 5+ | A burst of "NO", "ไม่", "WRONG" text sprays out of the click and falls. These are preview elements, so nothing is added to the board or the undo history. |
| 7+ | Every third level, a fake "Deleting your board... 99%" progress toast. Nothing is deleted. |
| 8+ | The text gets mangled with combining characters. |

The lines are in `src/tantrum-script.ts` and the effects in `src/tantrum.ts`.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # dev server on http://localhost:5173
```

In Drawdy, open a local board, press `⌘K` and run **Add extension dev server** with `http://localhost:5173`. Drawdy reloads the extension on every save. On each load the extension removes its own elements and rebuilds the stage it was on.

```bash
pnpm test         # maze, laser judge, shapes, fall animation, Diny escape, color contrast
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build        # dist/stupidhack-x-challenge.drawdyx
```

## Diny

Diny is two images on the Drawdy CDN, `https://cdn.drawdy.io/stupid-hackathonx/diny-mouth-close.png` and `diny-mouth-open.png`. Both are on the board; the one not shown is moved off the canvas with a preview transform, so swapping is local and nothing syncs.

## How it works

- `src/game.ts` runs the stage order (intro, buttons, find-rect, diny, maze, finale), the Go transition, and the reset to the intro when a required element is removed.
- Every element the extension adds carries `meta.stupidHackathonX = { stage, role }`. On load, the extension reads these tags to find the stage to resume and removes the old elements.
- Diny, the maze walls and the maze markers move with `command:scene:begin-preview` and `command:scene:preview-transforms`. The movement is local to the person running the extension. Collaborators see these elements at their starting positions.
- Challenge 5 starts a run when `subscription:scene:pointer` reports a press on the Start circle and the active tool is `laser-pointer`. Each `subscription:scene:pointer-position` sample after that is checked against the wall positions at that moment. `subscription:tool:laser` fires on release and ends the run.
- Text on the canvas uses a light or dark palette picked from `ModuleStyling.theme` and is recolored on `subscription:dom:theme-changed`. Text inside the XP windows uses the light palette, since the windows are light in both themes. `src/theme.test.ts` checks every text color for 4.5:1 contrast.
- When the rectangle is found, the 8,000 shapes fall with a keyframed `LocalAnimation` (a small lift, then an accelerating drop with spin and fade, staggered per shape) and are removed when it ends.
- Challenge 1 reads your own entry from `command:collaboration:get-all-users-in-board` and rechecks on `subscription:collaboration:presence-changed`. The protocol has no signed-in flag, so you count as signed up if you have an avatar, or if your name is not one of Drawdy's random guest names ("Adjective Animal", copied from `frontend/src/features/collaboration/constants.ts` into `src/sign-up.ts`). Renaming yourself also passes. If the `collaboration` permission is denied, you pass anyway.
- The finale shows your avatar (or your color and initial), your name, and whether you are signed in.
- Challenge 3 puts one shape in each 72 px grid cell, with at least 28 px between neighbours, so no tile of the canvas gets crowded. The field is about 8,200 by 5,100 px for 8,000 shapes. Once the rectangle is found, the camera moves to it and the Go button appears there.
- Challenge 3 adds at most `10,000 - (elements already on the board) - 60` shapes, because boards are capped at 10,000 elements.

Permissions: `scene` (everything on the canvas), `dom` (toasts) and `collaboration` (your name and avatar).
